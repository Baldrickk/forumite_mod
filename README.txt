Requires functionality from XVM.  If you wish to use this mod with as little of xvm enabled as possible, https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/95247514/minimalXVM.zip is a fairly minimal config setup with most xvm functionality disabled.
If WOT is not installed in the default directory, please edit the install.bat file to point at your WOT installation. (right click, edit, to open in notepad)
Double click on install.bat to install mod.
